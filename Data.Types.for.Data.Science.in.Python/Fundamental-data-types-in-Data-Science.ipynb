    "# Fundamental data types in Data Science\n",
    ">This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental Python data types - lists, sets, and tuples. These data containers are critical as they provide the basis for storing and looping over ordered data. To make things interesting, you'll apply what you learn about these types to answer questions about the New York Baby Names dataset! This is the Summary of lecture \"Data Types for Data Science in Python\", via datacamp.\n",

If you have a tuple like `('chocolate chip cookies', 15)` and you want to access each part of the data, you can use an index just like a list. However, you can also \"unpack\" the tuple into multiple variables such as type, `count = ('chocolate chip cookies', 15)` that will set type to 'chocolate chip cookies' and count to 15.\n",
